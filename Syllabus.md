# Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice

## Course Overview

- **Objective** Students will engage in a team or individual project to leverage the search engine techniques learned during the course (e.g., ranking, crawling, content analysis and detection, and query models).

- **Expectation** The class will include lectures on topics relating to search engine technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments. Programming assignments will augment the theoretical aspects of information retrieval. Please understand that this is a graduate-level and upper-division engineering course. As such, students are expected to devote a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.*

## Logistics

- **Instructors** John J. Tran and Eric Liao
- **Office Hours** An hour after class
- **Text Book** _Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice_ by Bruce Croft, Donald Metzler, and Trevor Strohman. ISBN: 978-0136072249.  Can be obtained from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Engines-Information-Retrieval-Practice/dp/0136072240) or the CSULA book store.
- **Course Slides** The lectures will follow very closely to the [Text Book Slides](http://www.search-engines-book.com/slides/)

## Learning Objectives

* Understand information retrieval theory
* Understand the makeup of search engine development
* Utilize Open Source tools to develop a complete search engine
* Explore newer information retrieval techniques and technology

## Grading Allocation

There will be quizzes that are based on textbook and papers.  The course will also include 4 programming assignments using Apache open source tools, i.e. Tika and Lucene and/or Nutch.  

1. Quiz - 40 points
2. Homework - 40 points
3. Project - 20 points

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project. Students will engage in a team or individual projects to leverage the opensource projects to facilitate their project development. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
